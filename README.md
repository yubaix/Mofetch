# Mofetch
Neofetch-based app for movies!

Heavily based off of [Mufetch](https://github.com/ashish0kumar/mufetch) by [Ashish Kumar](https://github.com/ashish0kumar), it is indicated in the files when some or all of the code for that file was taken from his project. Go check out his project, he deserves tons of credit.

I'll update this README when I feel the program is ready enough for others to use.
